EUDL architecture document

Mainserver - doesn't really do anything really, except offering an IRC server
EUDL-server - handles matchmaking and all that stuff
EUDL-client - client application

EUDL-client -> EUDL-server commands:
	(commands inspired by ixmike88, http://ixdl.net/index.php/topic/2-command-list/)
	(command character is ".", so you have to type ".COMMAND")
	create - Creates a new game.
	abort - Aborts the game you created with "create"
	sign [game id, ex "1337"] - Signs you up for a already running game, if no Identifier is specified, you'll join the next best open game.
	unsign - Removes you of a previously signed game.
	confirm - Confirms the current game, and starts it, you must be host tho.
	result <0, 1, 2, draw, radiant, dire> - Gives your vote for the result of the game.

	kick - Kicks a player from your lobby.
